One powerful concept that I keep coming back to is _Ontological Humility_, from Fred Kofman's incredible book [Conscious Business]. There are many good summaries of the concept online; I liked [this one][ontological-humility].

I'm going to take this a step further, and talk about leading through _"I don't know."_

### tl;dr:
Before we go on, here's the tl;dr on Ontological Humility:
* It means to accept we don't know everything about anything useful.
* It lets us tamp down on the Ego, and keep learning and growing.
* It leads us to be curious about disagreements instead of turning them into power struggles.

## Myth: Leaders Know Everything
A pervasive (and harmful) myth that pop-culture encourages is the idea of a Hero Leader: a person who knows everything about everything in their domain, and can individually take decisive action that ends up saving everyone's lives. Parts of this _are_ true: leaders do know quite a bit, and they are essentially paid to take action. However, a far more important part of any leader's job - and yes, I mean the celebrated _tech lead_ as well - is to know what they don't know.

The world we live and work in is increasingly complex. Beyond the smallest of teams, things move too quickly for any one person to maintain knowledge of systems. Ontological humility isn't just aspirational, in my mind it's the only non-delusional way to approach life and work.

## Why I say I don't know
Of course, _Ontological Humility_ is a mouthful, and the word is unfamiliar enough that it doesn't mean anything to most people. That's why I practice it with a very simple phrase: _I don't know._

Whenever I say this, it reminds me that:
1. I work with smart people and when I disagree with them, I don't really know why they think what they think.
2. My job is not to know things, but to get things done.
3. There's so much opportunity every day to learn something I didn't know before.

There's a knock on effect as well: folks that I work with feel empowered to say the same. This is especially true of more junior colleagues who are most likely to be closest to the work. They're less likely to pass off a guess as fact, and the _quality_ of information that is shared with me is far better.

## What happens next?
Fun fact: my grandfather _despised_ the phrase _"I don't know"_. He loved his grandchildren dearly, but all I had to say to a question was _"I don't know"_ and sit there staring blankly for 5 seconds before all hell broke loose.

You see, his perspective was this: it's all well to admit you don't know, but what are you going to do about it? Knowing that I don't know is half the battle - the rest is to use this information to move forward. In that spirit, here are my favorite follow ons.

* **...tell me more:** I use this most often. It is a powerful way of modeling servant leadership: _"You know more than I do, and I request you for more information. My job is to use that information to help you."_
* **...I'll find out:** I use this when I'm asked a question I honestly don't know the answer to. I say I'll get back to them by a certain time - and make sure I do. It was really difficult to do this in rooms with more senior people, but over time I've realized they appreciate the candor. (This is also what my grandfather expected me to say every time!)
* **...let's find out:** This is probably my favorite. I use this a lot when pairing with folks on their work. Many times we come up with an idea, but don't know how to evaluate or implement it. By collaborating to find out, I can show (and learn) how best to find the answer.
* **...does it matter?:** This is a tricky one, and I use it sparingly since it could go over as dismissive. When I notice a conversation might be devolving into "Engineer-speak" (where we're debating details that are far removed from the issue at hand) I shock the conversation by somewhat suddenly indicating that I don't know and don't really care. Sometimes it helps move the conversation along - other times, my colleague passionately explains _why_ it matters, and I get a lot of information about where they're coming from. 

## Learning Culture
A culture that makes it okay to admit we don't know everything and prioritizes puzzling out answers is a learning culture. Think of it as [growth mindset][mindset], at the organizational level.

Learning cultures are powerful for many reason, but my favorite one is because they are _inclusive_: it doesn't matter that you joined yesterday, or that you didn't do a traditional CS course - we here prioritize finding things out and getting things done.

Moving from "knowing" to "doing" as the unit of performance empowers folks of all stripes to contribute, and that's a wonderful thing.

## Summary
Leading with _"I don't know"_ when done right can be incredibly empowering for a team and in breaking down barriers like [Imposter Syndrome]; in this way, it's especially suited to teams of diverse individuals. Modeling different ways to tackle the lack of knowledge helps us create a robust learning culture.
