I find the weirdness of learning something new fascinating, and I try to observe myself and others going through the process. One particular technique I've realized recently is "learning by overfitting" - I'll explain what I mean by that, why I think it is helpful, and how to guard it against the forces of [Imposter Syndrome][imposter-syndrome].

_If you're interested, I wrote a [longer post][imposter-syndrome-me] about Imposter Syndrome previously._

## Notes
* Inspiration - toddler playing
    * Similarity to ideas
* Learning by Overfitting
    - Try it everywhere
    - See where it works and doesn't
    - Tune mental model of concept
* Imposter Syndrome
    - When everything is a hammer...
    - Disadvantage
    - How to collaborate better
