I've been thinking a lot about [Imposter Syndrome][imposter-syndrome] lately. As I work with many engineers and we discuss techniques to be more effective, I recognize that some of the simplest things that can help everyone just don't get done. Reflecting on _why_ they don't get done brings me time and again to Imposter Syndrome. I believe that taking simple steps to counter this everyday is one of the best ways to affect positive changes in our industry.

## What is Imposter Syndrome?
Imposter syndrome essentially means that a person thinks that they tricked their way into their current job, that they're a fraud who'll be eventually found out, and that they don't belong.

There isn't any method to who this affects the most and why. The core ingredient seems to be some sort of "exclusive" club, and the Tech Industry fits that bill. I've observed - surprisingly - that there is little correlation between character traits and feeling this way as well: for example, extroverted types seem to feel it as much as introverted ones. Seniority confers little defense too. Personally, I believe that under-represented minorities (URMs) feel it more keenly since this is a question of belonging, and they probably look around and go _"Well, do I really belong in this industry?"_.

## How does it hurt performance?
One of my firm beliefs is that the most robust way to grow and improve rapidly is to get great feedback as quickly as you can - ship early, ship often. This frequently means sharing work-in-progress at key points, _before_ it's "ready". Sharing early helps make it easy for our collaborators to give us feedback, and for us to accept it. Hopefully, we work in an environment where our peers have valuable and different perspectives, and that’s why this technique makes our execution better.

But frequently, I notice engineers hesitate, thinking: _"Just a little more work, until this is **worthy** of being shared."_. Yes, we _ought_ to separate our work from ourselves - but only the most self-assured seem able to do this consistently. So sharing incomplete work to most of us means to take a leap of faith: to be vulnerable and put ourselves out there in all our work's imperfection.

To me, there seems an obvious correlation between experiencing imposter syndrome and missing out on helpful feedback that supercharges growth.

### Diversity and Inclusion
As I alluded to earlier, our URM colleagues feel imposter syndrome and its effects more keenly. This means that their performance is likely _more_ affected than others'.

If we believe D&I is important - if not for any moral arguments, for just [the practical benefits][why-di] - then recognizing imposter syndrome and making structural and cultural changes to combat it is essential.

## What makes it worse?
Here are a few parts of tech that I think help aggravate imposter syndrome:

* **Celebrating Capability**: Much of the narrative around tech celebrates capability, not necessarily learning. There are way more war stories of the 10x engineer who single-handedly fixes a show-stopping issue at 2am; or pulls 3 straight all-nighters on Red Bull and pizza, and gets a working prototype up in time for a launch. This provides a context where engineers feel like they ought to know how to do something, and asking a question makes them look incapable.
* **Aggressive Communication**: The roots of our industry lies in math, science, and academia; there is a certain celebration of hyper-rationality which is perhaps fine when debugging lines of code, but is unhelpful in the 80% of other things we do that isn't so black-and-white. Hyper-rational, blunt, and borderline aggressive communication with the belief that "the stronger idea will survive" is unhelpful when there are so many who feel like outsiders - they'll probably shrink away before presenting their thoughts out of fear of rejection.
* **Everyone’s Busy**: In a well functioning and growing organization, there’s probably more than enough work to go around and keep everyone busy. Newer engineers notice this - and they feel like they’re harming the team by asking someone for help.

## How can we help?
There are specific techniques we can use to counter each of the factors above:

* **Celebrate Achievement**: In [Thinking in Bets][bets], poker champion Annie Duke mentions that one key thing companies can do is to "value accuracy, not knowledge". Saying it slightly differently, an organization that values the _doing_ of things (like "delivering a well designed feature") over the _knowing_ of things (like "how to write efficient python") will make it easier for individuals to ask questions in order to get things done. As more people say _"I don't know"_, the identity of the group becomes to ask good questions instead of knowing things; this new state is a lot more democratic and achievable.
  * A specific sub-technique is to model how everyone is always learning by sharing your work in progress. Just watching an established, respected colleague share clearly incomplete work with an appeal for help is powerful. Seeing the unvarnished `git log` of a star engineer is reassurance that even the best make missteps, and things are not as linear as they seem.
  * A really powerful technique as a mentor or senior engineer is to say _"[I don't know][dont-know], let's find out together"_, or to say _"Here's what I learned from \<a specific source>"_. This tip courtesy [Morgan Weaver][mweaver-linkedin]'s great talk at vGHC 2020
* **Inclusive Communication**: Whatever efficiency gains are made from blunt communication are lost many times over when we consider the diverse voices that decline to join the conversation. There are many techniques to pivot to more inclusive communication - ask questions instead of making statements; provide reasoning for opinions instead of stating them as fact; etc. However, the more meaningful change is in mindset. Leading from authority is simpler and more efficient, but also fragile since a single person's opinions flows through many people. Leading with curiosity is more complex and roundabout, but also robust since many people's opinions flow into the organization. _Invite_ discussion with markers like _"This is what I've done before - I'm curious why you've done it this way"_ or the ridiculously copy-pastable _"What do you think?"_ or _"What am I missing?"_.
* **Extend Help Proactively**: You know the people new to your org, your team, or your domain. Regardless of how self-assured they may _seem_, consider taking a small step of asking them how they're doing and if you can help with anything. It doesn't need to be anything fancy - just a hallway chat or a DM saying hi, you noticed them, and you're open to help. If you have reason to believe they definitely do need help, repeat the offer.

## Closing Notes
Hopefully, these patterns and anti-patterns help you identify small ways to make a large difference to your teams. D&I is a huge topic, and so is imposter syndrome, and I have no doubt that I've barely scratched their surfaces here. Luckily, based on my reading and experience, these techniques should help any individual affect change without knowing all that background.

Finally, a confession: I've focused on the _practical_ aspects and the effect of combating imposter syndrome on the work output. For me though, it is far more rewarding to see the change in texture and tone of a team's conversation when people feel secure. Work just becomes more fun, and my colleagues help me learn and develop so much with minimal effort. It's well worth giving these techniques a shot.
