As I've grown more senior, I've become more aware of the _leverage_ of things that I do. There's one flavor of this that I love: people leverage.

## People Leverage
People leverage is to gain outsized efficiencies for the organization, but instead of doing this directly we do it via other people. This is a fundamental shift for us as engineers, since this is no longer about us and our work, or even how other people affect that work. It is about expanding the scope of our work to include other people, and about working through them to achieve great things.

Donâ€™t take my word for it - have a read through the [Staff Eng Stories][staff-eng] and notice how every story of more senior engineering roles involves working with, and through other people.

There are two broad ways in which you can build people leverage - you can build up people directly, or you can build them up indirectly by making their job easier. This post is about the former.
