### Notes
* Why say I don't know: ontological humility
    - Effect on myself
    - Effect on others
* What happens next
    - Grandfather's dislike of "I don't know"
    - "...tell me more"
    - "...let's find out"
    - "...I'll find out"
    - "...does it matter?"
* Culture
    - Emphasize doing, not knowing
    - Learning++
