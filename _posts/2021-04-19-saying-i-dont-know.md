One powerful concept that I keep coming back to is _Ontological Humility_, from Fred Kofman's incredible book [Conscious Business]. There are many good summaries of the concept online; I liked [this one][Ontological Humility].

I'm going to take this a step further, and talk about leading through _"I don't know."_

### tl;dr:
* Ontological Humility is to understand we don't know everything about anything useful.
* It lets us tamp down on the Ego, and keep learning and growing.
* Leading with _"I don't know"_ when done right can be incredibly empowering for a team, especially breaking down barriers like [Imposter Syndrome].

## Myth: Leaders Know Everything
A pervasive (and harmful) myth that pop-culture encourages is the idea of a Hero Leader: a person who knows everything about everything in their domain, and can individually take decisive action that ends up saving everyone's lives. Parts of this _are_ true: leaders do know quite a bit, and they are essentially paid to take action. However, a far more important part of any leader's job - and yes, I mean the celebrated _tech lead_ as well - is to know what they don't know.

The world we live and work in is increasingly complex. Beyond the smallest of teams, things move too quickly for any one person to maintain knowledge of systems. Ontological humility isn't just aspirational, in my mind it's the only non-delusional way to approach life.

## Why I say I don't know
Of course, _Ontological Humility_ is a mouthful, and the word is unfamiliar enough that it doesn't mean anything to most people. That's why I practice it with a very simple phrase: _I don't know._

Whenever I say this, it reminds me that:
1. I work with smart people and when I disagree with them, I don't really know why they think what they think.
2. My job is not to know things, but to get things done.
3. There's so much opportunity every day to learn something I didn't know before.

There's a knock on effect as well: folks that I work with feel empowered to say the same. This is especially true of more junior colleagues who are most likely to be closest to the work. They're less likely to pass off a guess as fact, and the _quality_ of information that is shared with me is far better.

## What happens next?
Fun fact: my grandfather _despised_ the phrase _"I don't know"_. He loved his grandchildren dearly, but all I had to say to a question was _"I don't know"_ and sit there staring blankly for 5 seconds before all hell broke loose.

You see, his perspective was this: it's all well to admit you don't know, but what are you going to do about it? Knowing that I don't know is half the battle - the rest is to use this information to move forward. In that spirit, here are my favorite follow ons.

* **...tell me more:**
* **...I'll find out:**
* **...let's find out:**
* **...does it matter?:**

## Learning Culture
A culture that makes it okay to admit we don't know everything and prioritizes puzzling out answers is a learning culture. Learning cultures are powerful for many reason, but my favorite one is because they are _inclusive_: it doesn't matter that you joined yesterday, or that you didn't do a traditional CS course - we here prioritize finding things out and getting things done.

Moving from "knowing" to "doing" as the unit of performance empowers folks of all stripes to contribute, and that's a wonderful thing.

## Summary
Leading through _"I don't know"_ can empower teams of diverse individuals to come together and achieve great things. Choosing how to tackle the lack of knowledge is important, and helps me model and create a learning culture.
