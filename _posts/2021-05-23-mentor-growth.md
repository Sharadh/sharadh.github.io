Over the last year, I've had the opportunity to mentor _a lot_ of engineers. A couple of times in these interactions, I've had this pretty weird feeling of watching myself in the third person and thinking, _"Who's this guy? Seems to know what he's doing."_ This is odd because when I started mentoring, I definitely didn't feel that way. Somewhere along the line I've grown as a mentor (and hopefully, will continue to.) In this post, I'll quickly reflect on that growth thus far.

## tl;dr
1. At first, I would focus on helping people *get to where I was* by *telling them what I did*.
2. Next, I pivoted to helping people *get to where I was* by *helping them find their own techniques*.
3. Now, I mostly try and help people *figure out where they want to go* by *asking questions and providing frameworks*.

## You are Me
_"What got me here will get you here too, and here is awesome!"_

The first stage, and what got me into mentoring, is when I figured I'm pretty good at doing something and could speed up someone else's learning. I also really liked explaining things to people, so I put these two together and essentially coached my mentees with techniques and the tricks of the trade - set up your IDE this way, do these sort of projects, etc.

This worked really well, but only up to a point. And that point was: _"Here's a person who learns differently from me. Oh shoot, what do I do now?"_

I've always been aware that my style of learning was different from other people - I tend to be more "old fashioned": bookish and structured, text based, and constructing a mental model _before_ trying experiments to validate it. When I started mentoring more folks who had a distinctly different style, I realized that I had to change how I approached the relationship.

## You Want What I Want
_"Here is awesome! - let's see how to get you here."_

So in the second stage, I started to put myself into my mentees' shoes. I learned by reading, but perhaps they learned best by doing. How could I pair with them, or give them chance to just try things before we dived into techniques? Perhaps they liked learning through multimedia - could I find a Youtube video or a podcast that might help? How could I take my learning from a Platform team, but then apply it to _their_ situation on a Frontend team?

When I was in this stage, I was still mentoring folks on my team or on adjacent teams. This meant I'd still have some idea of where they were, and their areas of growth. As the organization grew and my role as well, this no longer was the case - and everything had to change, again.

## What do you Want?
_"You are a beautiful snowflake. [Tell  me more][tell-me-more]."_

These days I start with a fairly humble assumption: I have no idea where my mentee wants to go. Part of my role - perhaps the most important part! - is to ask them questions and [provide frameworks][archetypes] that help them think about their career. A large part of this is helping them ask questions: What are the assumptions they've made on how they _have_ to grow? Why do they think they need to grow in certain ways?

Techniques are useful too - _especially_ when tied to an active project that they're grappling with. Timely and specific feedback on concrete things helps ground any abstract or philosophical discussions in reality. However, in the absence of the abstract mental model for growth, the techniques don't have [anything to hang onto][mental-models] and eventually dissipate. 

### Aside: Limits to Growth
Having recently read [The Fifth Discipline][5th-discipline] I've come to think of this as a _Limits to Growth_ ([1][limits-1],[2][limits-2]) scenario: I was previously spending a lot of _effort_ on techniques to improve performance, but a far more useful approach is to tackle the _constraint_ of how my mentee views their own growth. Without that vision and the frameworks to concretely articulate the vision, the default setting was to just do more of the same, which resulted in a growth ceiling.

## Summary
Having started from an assumption that my mentees were basically me, but earlier in their careers, I've now grown to realize that does not scale. My most important role as mentor is as a guide who can point out the different paths, but ultimately help them take the decision on what they want and how to get there.
