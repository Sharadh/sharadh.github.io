Over the last year, I've had the opportunity to mentor _a lot_ of engineers. A couple of times in these interactions, I've had this pretty weird feeling of watching myself in the third person and thinking, _"Who's this guy? Seems to know what he's doing."_ This is odd because when I started mentoring, I definitely didn't feel that way. Somewhere along the line I've grown as a mentor (and hopefully, will continue to.) In this post, I'll quickly reflect on that growth thus far.

## Stage 1
_"What got me here will get you here too, and here's **awesome!**_

The first stage, and what got me into mentoring, is when I figured I'm pretty good at doing something and could speed up someone else's learning. I've also really liked "teaching" or "explaining" things to people, so I put these two together and essentially coached my mentees with techniques and the tricks of the trade - set up your IDE this way, do these sort of projects, etc.

This worked really well, but only up to a point. And that point was: "Here's a person who learns differently from me. Oh god."

I've always been aware that my style of learning was different from other people - I tend to be more "old fashioned": bookish and structured, text based, and constructing a mental model _before_ trying experiments to validate it. When I started mentoring more folks who had a distinctly different style, I realized that I had to change how I approached the relationship.

## Stage 2
_"Here's **awesome!** - let's see how to get you here._

So in the second stage, I started to put myself into my mentees' shoes. I learned by reading, but perhaps they learn best by doing How can I pair with them, or give them chance to just try things before we dived into techniques? Perhaps they like learning through multimedia - could I find a Youtube video or a podcast that might help? How could I take my learning from a Platform team, but then apply it to _their_ situation on a Frontend team?

When I was in this stage, I was still mentoring folks on my team or on adjacent teams. This meant I'd still have some idea of where they were, and their areas of growth. As the organization grew and my role as well, this no longer was the case - and everything had to change, again.

## Stage 3
_"You are a beautiful snowflake. Tell  me more."_



### Notes
* What worked for me will work for them
* What worked for me may not work; but they want the same thing
* This is a beautiful snowflake
    * The only real way is to help them look inward for the solution
    * Techniques really help too, especially when can be attached to an active project (i.e they have agency)
