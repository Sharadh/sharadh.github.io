A group of us were talking about the value of technical writing, and there was an excellent question: _What happens if my colleagues just don't believe writing documentation is worth it?_.

I personally believe that documentation _is_ useful in a vast majority of cases, and I also know that being able to empathize and work with those who don't is a major part of being a successful engineer. So, let's see why this disagreement happens and what we can do about it.

## Scenario
Let's take an example: you join a new team, and are enthusiastic to make a contribution - to make a mark! You realize there's a simple way: the team has built a lot of things recently and the documentation is patchy. So as you ramp up you write down your learnings and share it with the team. Instead of an equally enthusiastic reception, a senior colleague - maybe even your tech lead! - is lukewarm.

At this point, it's easy and perhaps even reasonable to conclude that your colleague is a philistine who has no appreciation for the craft of Software Engineering. But that doesn't really get us anywhere. Like Fred Kofman says in _Conscious Business_, we need to take the attitude of a _player_ who can affect the game, not a _spectator_  who takes it for what it is.

## The Problem
At a high level we can approach this like any other engineering issue - with a dispassionate analysis of the pros and cons, a simple cost/benefit analysis. But if we do, we'll quickly realize that with documentation _both_ the cost and the benefit are subjective. We may believe that we get great value from documentation - that a well written comment, a module overview, or a project readme make us tangibly more productive. We may also think that it's not that much effort for us to add the documentation while we're around the work.

But our colleagues may disagree about both sides of this equation.

This is why conversations about the value of documentation can be exceedingly frustrating: often, the two parties are operating with different _axioms_ about the domain.

## Cost
* Cost:
    - Effort to write and maintain docs
    - _More difficult_ for folks who aren't used to doing it

## Benefit
* Benefit:
    - Value of having docs around
    - _Lots_ of bad tech writing out there
    - _High probability_ that when colleague thinks "benefits" they think "eh, pass."

## Reality and Evidence Based Reasoning
* Reality:
    - Folks extrapolate off their own experiences
    - Rational reasoning won't work because your axioms are just different
    - Need to get common ground
        + Ask them for examples where docs helped them. If they say "never" they are either an extreme case of a certain style of learning, or unaware. Ask others in pod, team, guild, or org. Fairly harmless request.
        + Understand what helps
        + Get evidence that it can be helpful to _someone else_ even if not themselves

## Caution: Confirmation Bias
* Caution: sometimes writing docs is not the right thing to do. Be aware if you're doing it because it's useful, or because you like it and it scratches an itch (that's ok, don't ask someone else to scratch it too.)

## Cross Reference: Types of Leadership
* Cross reference: diversity is important, styles of leadership that allow for other opinions help a ton to avoid such situations
