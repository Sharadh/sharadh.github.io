A group of us were talking about the value of technical writing, and there was an excellent question: _What happens if my colleagues just don't believe writing documentation is worth it?_.

This is hard - not least because 

## Summary
...

## Notes
* Senior colleague (maybe tech lead?) says docs are pointless
* Simple: cost/benefit analysis
    - Problem: cost and benefit are both subjective
* Cost:
    - Effort to write and maintain docs
    - _More difficult_ for folks who aren't used to doing it
* Benefit:
    - Value of having docs around
    - _Lots_ of bad tech writing out there
    - _High probability_ that when colleague thinks "benefits" they think "eh, pass."
* Reality:
    - Folks extrapolate off their own experiences
    - Rational reasoning won't work because your axioms are just different
    - Need to get common ground
        + Ask them for examples where docs helped them. If they say "never" they are either an extreme case of a certain style of learning, or unaware. Ask others in pod, team, guild, or org. Fairly harmless request.
        + Understand what helps
        + Get evidence that it can be helpful to _someone else_ even if not themselves
* Caution: sometimes writing docs is not the right thing to do. Be aware if you're doing it because it's useful, or because you like it and it scratches an itch (that's ok, don't ask someone else to scratch it too.)
* Cross reference: diversity is important, styles of leadership that allow for other opinions help a ton to avoid such situations
