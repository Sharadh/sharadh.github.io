This weekend is Father's Day - but I haven't seen my parents in person for ~18mo due to the pandemic. My son turned 18mo yesterday, and as he's growing I can see him consciously observing me and my wife and learning from us. There are the small things - like how he reaches over to his Mom and tells her how tasty his food is, exactly like I do - because he knows it makes her happy. He's learned that from me, but he'll probably forget that, and it'll just be part of his personality.

I know this, because I learned it from my dad, and until recently I've not noticed just how much of my personality has been informed by him.

## Who Luck
Jim Collins talks about ["Who" luck][who-luck]:
> People think about luck as kind of “what” luck but I’ve had great “who” luck in my life. And “who” luck is when you come across somebody who changes your trajectory or invests in you, bets on you, gives you guidance and key points.

A lot of growth in our careers is non-technical: it's a lot about working _with people_ in a technical context. I know this by experience in Software Engineering, and my reading suggests this is true in most others.

Most of this non-technical stuff isn't science, it's an art: this means there's a lot of contradiction, an inexplicable simplicity when seeing it in action, and an overbearing complexity when reading about it. That's where I think role models come in, and where "Who" luck plays a huge role in career success.

## Dad Luck
Of the lot, what could be more down to luck, more completely out of our control, than the parents we have? I feel fortunate to have had _two_ incredible role models in my parents, and _even more_ in my extended family. But today's post is about my Dad specifically, so let's dive right in.

### Don't take yourself too seriously
This one is first because it sets the tone for pretty much everything, including the rest of this post. It's important for me because I can get quite intense and hyper-focused on doing the best with the job at hand. My Dad is always smiling - either from a (dad) joke he's cracked, or quite often at a joke someone else has cracked at his expense! This helps me ease up, appreciate the messiness of life, and just be in a state of mind where good behaviors and ideas happen.

### Make people comfortable
Maya Angelou has these words of wisdom:
> “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

There's a school of thought that goes: emotions and feelings get in the way, the best ideas ought to do battle and the best one will win. But over time, people don't remember what you say, only you made them feel - and _people_ need to carry out the execution of any idea. Most people are frustrated by this, and just can't see why this is a thing. Luckily, my dad is _incredible_ at helping people feel comfortable, so I have a well of experience to draw from during the frustrating times. He accepts people where they are, and finds ways to connect with them instead of trying to change them. He's fond of

### Notes
* Things I learned from my dad
  * Smile, laugh, and have a good time - even at work
  * ~~People don't remember what you say, but how you made them feel~~
  * The cleverest person who can't connect with people is doomed
  * Focus on the outcome for you - let the other "soft stuff" slide off
  * ~~Don't take yourself too seriously~~
  * Trust yourself to wing it
  * Find something more than yourself to work for (my mom)
