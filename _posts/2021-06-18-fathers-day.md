This weekend is Father's Day - but I haven't seen my parents in person for ~18mo due to the pandemic. My son turned 18mo yesterday, and as he's growing I can see him consciously observing me and my wife and learning from us. There are the small things - like how he reaches over to his Mom and tells her how tasty his food is, exactly like I do - because he knows it makes her happy. He's learned that from me, but he'll probably forget that, and it'll just be part of his personality.

I know this, because I learned it from my dad, and until recently I've not noticed just how much of my personality has been informed by him.

## Who Luck
Jim Collins talks about ["Who" luck][who-luck]:
> People think about luck as kind of “what” luck but I’ve had great “who” luck in my life. And “who” luck is when you come across somebody who changes your trajectory or invests in you, bets on you, gives you guidance and key points.

A lot of growth in our careers is non-technical: it's a lot about working _with people_ in a technical context. I know this by experience in Software Engineering, and my reading suggests this is true in most others.

Most of this non-technical stuff isn't science, it's an art: this means there's a lot of contradiction, an inexplicable simplicity when seeing it in action, and an overbearing complexity when reading about it. That's where I think role models come in, and where "Who" luck plays a huge role in career success.

## Dad Luck
Of the lot, what could be more down to luck, more completely out of our control, than the parents we have? I feel fortunate to have had _two_ incredible role models in my parents, and _even more_ in my extended family. But today's post is about my Dad specifically, so let's dive right in.

### Don't take yourself too seriously
This one is first because it sets the tone for pretty much everything, including the rest of this post. It's important for me because I can get quite intense and hyper-focused on doing the best with the job at hand. My Dad is always smiling - either from a (dad) joke he's cracked, or quite often at a joke someone else has cracked at his expense! Remembering this helps me ease up, appreciate the messiness of life, and just be in a state of mind where good behaviors and ideas happen. I actively try to smile, laugh, and have a good time - even at work.

tl;dr: My dad modeled [The Happiness Advantage][happiness-advantage] before I had a chance to read the book.


### Make people comfortable
Maya Angelou has these words of wisdom:
> “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

There's a school of thought that goes: emotions and feelings get in the way, the best ideas ought to do battle and the best one will win. But over time, people don't remember what you say, only you made them feel - and _people_ need to carry out the execution of any idea. Most people are frustrated by this, and just can't see why this is a thing. Luckily, my dad is _incredible_ at helping people feel comfortable, so I have a well of experience to draw from during the frustrating times. He accepts people where they are, and finds ways to connect with them instead of trying to change them. He's fond of general proclamations that are mostly true (and I'm fond of pointing out when they aren't), and one of his favorites is:
> You can be the smartest guy in the room, but if you can't connect with other people, you're doomed.

### Focus on the outcome
One of my dad's famous statements go something like this:
> Call me what you want, but pay me what you said.

He'd say this when there was a lot of "messiness" at work: a lot of politics floating around, primarily posturing and grandstanding. He was an entrepreneur, and a lot of this would come up when he needed to get paid by a client. His attitude was that the trappings don't matter: how much praise someone lavishes, the title they grant, or something of that nature. What matters is that they do what they say. Everything else - including what someone may or may not be saying about you - is just noise.

Like possibly every person entering industry, I used to approach conversation from Ego. To me it was about being right, being recognized, being rewarded - and those things a lot more than the outcome. This was stressful and unfulfilling, and over time I found it easier to just focus on the outcome. Many years later, [Conscious Business][conscious-business] taught me that _"you have to love the relationship more than you love yourself"_, and that's a behavior I've had the benefit of seeing first-hand early in my life.

### Trust yourself to wing it
My dad dislikes exams and evaluations of all kinds. Specifically, he dislikes the lead up to the evaluation: the stress of making sure everything is covered, the anxiety that things will be fine, and that gnawing feeling that you could always be doing something more. His stance is that if you've been doing the right thing leading up to the moment, the moment itself is incidental: trust yourself to wing it.

This is probably my favorite one: I've practiced it as a child and continue to do so as an adult. Specifically with any presentation - be it to my team, my org, my company or [at a conference][reinvent-talk] - I prepare until I get that feeling of _"oh, maybe I should do it one more time just to make sure"_, but then I stop. I _love_ presenting, and over-preparing removes the joy of speaking from the heart and surfing the moment. Or, in the words of Cristiano Ronaldo per one training ground story from his time at Manchester United:
> Too much watering kills the plant.

### Work for something more than yourself
This is something my dad has never actually said out loud, but it's the most important thing he's modeled for me. Before I had any idea who [Abraham Maslow][maslow-hierarchy] was, I knew it was important to dedicate myself to things greater than myself. In my dad's case, it's my mom (yeah, they're really cute) and he does this in the little ways every day. So apart from the little tips and techniques that (hopefully) make me a totally awesome person to live with, what I've learned from my dad is that doing it all for someone I love makes every second of every day - the boring stuff, the challenging stuff, the joyous stuff - all equally meaningful and joyful.

## Summary
1. Don't take yourself too seriously
2. Make people comfortable
3. Focus on the outcome
4. Trust yourself to wing it
5. Work for something more than yourself

_Caveat: There's a host of things that I've learned from my mom as well, and she can probably claim some credit for the stuff up here, but that's for next Mother's Day ;)_

## Gratitude
Reflecting on what I've learned from my parents, and extrapolating what they learned from theirs and so on really puts into perspective the challenges that folks from non-mainstream backgrounds face in the industry. Perhaps they're from URMs and don't have a model for what success looks like in tech, or perhaps they're first-generation college grads and don't have a model for what a successful career looks like. Either way, it makes me feel incredibly grateful for these things I've been blessed with, and motivated to share what I can with anyone else.
