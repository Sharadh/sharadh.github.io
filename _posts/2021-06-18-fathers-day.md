### Notes
* Things I learned from my dad
  * Smile, laugh, and have a good time - even at work
  * People don't remember what you say, but how you made them feel
  * The cleverest person who can't connect with people is doomed
  * Focus on the outcome for you - let the other "soft stuff" slide off
  * Don't take yourself too seriously
  * Trust yourself to wing it
  * Find something more than yourself to work for (my mom)
