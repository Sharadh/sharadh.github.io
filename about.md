Hello, and thanks for stopping by! I'm Sharadh, a Software Engineer working with [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com) in the San Francisco Bay Area. You can find more about my professional experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharadhk/). This is my professional blog about the craft of Software Engineering.

### Why am I writing here?
I've been lucky to work with - and learn from - some great colleagues in my career, and am passionate about giving back to the community so everyone can access these learnings. One of my goals is to write a book that serves as a guide for new engineers as they navigate their career, and I figured a blog is a nice Agile way of working towards that.

### What do I write about?
Most of the content focuses on career management, 
mentoring, techniques for better results, etc - there'll also be the rare one that goes into the weeds of some really technical problem. For the most part though, I hope to share my perspectives on the intangibles of the craft that support and reflect in great tangible results.

### What does success look like?
I think a lot about how I communicate because I firmly believe that for diversity in tech to actually improve, the way we communicate with each other needs to evolve. I'd consider this blog a success if anyone reading it - especially those without a "mainstream" background - feels like they learned _something_, and in a way that inspires a kinder communication style in our industry. I love the process of setting information down in a consumable way anyway; even if single-digit people find what I write useful, it's a win-win!

### Gratitude
The list of people to thank is too large for this page - which is why there's [another one](/gratitude/) dedicated just for that.

This site is built using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
