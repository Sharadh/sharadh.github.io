I'm a huge fan of the Farnam Street Blog, _specifically_ the focus on Mental Models.

> **What Are Mental Models?**
> Mental models are how we understand the world. Not only do they shape what we think and how we understand but they shape the connections and opportunities that we see. Mental models are how we simplify complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason.

One pet project of mine is to round up the 10 most impactful mental models that I've learned in my career and share them with others - maybe even through a small book! These _Mental Models for Software Engineering_ are meant to be high-leverage, and share _ways of seeing_ that are transferable across companies, cultures, and careers.

0. Primer: Mental models are like software for your thinking
1. Ways of working together
2. Serging - things come apart at the seams
3. Technical debt is like debt on time
4. Styles of leadership and tradeoffs
5. Today's Truths / Limits and Growth
6. Future welcome
7. Conway's Law
8. Gestalt and Emergent Value / Behavior
9. Prototypes vs. Competition
10. People are Probabilistic / Ideas & gossip protocols
11. (Bonus) Bodymind awareness is like monitoring for your mental models
