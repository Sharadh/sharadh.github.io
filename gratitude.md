I'm acutely conscious that I'm lucky. Apart from lucking into a family that valued - and invested in - my learning and development, I've had this thing the author Jim Collins calls _"People Luck"_:

> People think about luck as kind of “what” luck but I’ve had great “who” luck in my life. And “who” luck is when you come across somebody who changes your trajectory or invests in you, bets on you, gives you guidance and key points.

I find that the practice of giving specific gratitude to specific people [makes everyone's life more enjoyable](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier). So even at the risk of leaving out someone important, here are a few colleagues that I consider critical to my development, in alphabetical order:

* **Evan Borgstrom**, who has shown me what visionary technical leadership looks like - and also first gave me external validation that I'm good at the _craft_ of Software Engineering.
* **Jeremy Lewis**, who by just being consistently and solidly good has helped me love working with diverse styles of people. Also, for showing it's okay to interleave family and work - just gotta be great at both ;)
* **Raj Pandian**, who took me under his wing when I was a fresh-faced college grad and showed how much there was to learn and love about programming _in industry!_
* ...
